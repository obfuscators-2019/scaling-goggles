THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF RANSOMWARE ? LOCKSCREEN RANSOMWARE AND ENCRYPTION RANSOMWARE. LOCKSCREEN RANSOMWARE SHOWS A FULL-SCREEN MESSAGE THAT 
PREVENTS YOU FROM ACCESSING YOUR PC OR FILES. IT SAYS YOU HAVE TO PAY MONEY (A RANSOM) TO GET ACCESS TO YOUR PC AGAIN. ENCRYPTION 
RANSOMWARE CHANGES YOUR FILES SO YOU CAN?T OPEN THEM. IT DOES THIS BY ENCRYPTING THE FILES ? SEE THE DETAILS FOR ENTERPRISES SECTION IF 
YOU?RE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNIQUES WE?VE SEEN. OLDER VERSIONS OF RANSOM USUALLY CLAIM YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING ILLEGAL 
WITH YOUR PC, AND THAT YOU ARE BEING FINED BY A POLICE FORCE OR GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THESE CLAIMS ARE FALSE. IT IS A SCARE TACTIC DESIGNED TO 
MAKE YOU PAY THE MONEY WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESTORE YOUR PC. NEWER VERSIONS ENCRYPT THE FILES ON YOUR PC SO YOU 
CAN?T ACCESS THEM, AND THEN SIMPLY DEMAND MONEY TO RESTORE YOUR FILES.

CRYPTOLOCKER IS A RANSOMWARE TROJAN THAT TARGETS COMPUTERS RUNNING MICROSOFT WINDOWS, BELIEVED TO HAVE FIRST BEEN POSTED TO THE 
INTERNET ON 5 SEPTEMBER 2013. CRYPTOLOCKER PROPAGATED VIA INFECTED EMAIL ATTACHMENTS, AND VIA AN EXISTING BOTNET; WHEN ACTIVATED, 
THE MALWARE ENCRYPTS CERTAIN TYPES OF FILES STORED ON LOCAL AND MOUNTED NETWORK DRIVES USING RSA PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY, WITH 
THE PRIVATE KEY STORED ONLY ON THE MALWARE'S CONTROL SERVERS. THE MALWARE THEN DISPLAYS A MESSAGE WHICH OFFERS TO DECRYPT THE 
DATA IF A PAYMENT (THROUGH EITHER BITCOIN OR A PRE-PAID CASH VOUCHER) IS MADE BY A STATED DEADLINE, AND THREATENED TO DELETE THE 
PRIVATE KEY IF THE DEADLINE PASSES. IF THE DEADLINE IS NOT MET, THE MALWARE OFFERED TO DECRYPT DATA VIA AN ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDED 
BY THE MALWARE'S OPERATORS, FOR A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRICE IN BITCOIN.

FLASHPOINT HAS CONFIRMED THAT SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DDOS) ATTACKS AGAINST 
DYN DNS WERE BOTNETS COMPROMISED BY MIRAI MALWARE. MIRAI BOTNETS WERE PREVIOUSLY USED IN DDOS ATTACKS AGAINST SECURITY RESEARCHER 
BRIAN KREBS? BLOG KREBS ON SECURITY AND FRENCH INTERNET SERVICE AND HOSTING PROVIDER OVH. MIRAI MALWARE TARGETS INTERNET OF THINGS 
(IOT) DEVICES LIKE ROUTERS, DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDS (DVRS), AND WEBCAMS/SECURITY CAMERAS, ENSLAVING VAST NUMBERS OF THESE DEVICES INTO 
A BOTNET, WHICH IS THEN USED TO CONDUCT DDOS ATTACKS. FLASHPOINT HAS CONFIRMED THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE DEVICES USED IN THE DYN DNS 
ATTACKS ARE DVRS, FURTHER MATCHING THE TECHNICAL INDICATORS AND TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUS KNOWN MIRAI 
BOTNET ATTACKS.
